        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Born and raised in NJ. Moved to OK for University. Got a B.S. in Meteorology with a Math minor. 
            Briefly lived in NH, ME, and NY following graduation.</p>
        <p>Currently working as a Mentor. Would love to get back into something at least tangentially 
            related to weather.</p>
        <p>Favorite hobbies include travel, video games, reading, and spending time with my dogs.</p>
        <p>My current long term projects include:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><a href="">1000 reads in my 30s</a> (link currently broken) - I'm challenging myself to read 
            more than I have before.</li>
            <li><a href="https://1001albumsgenerator.com/shares/664f61920b5c7a126479047f">1001 Albums</a> I 
            don't really listen to music anymore, so I thought I would give this a try.</li>
        </ol>
